ABOUT:  Using a mathematical model of cassette tape counters published by Arnold J. Insel ("Cassette Tape: Predicting Recording Time," The UMAP Journal, Vol. V, No. 2, 1984, pp. 200â€“214), this utility allows you to determine the approximate time for a given cassette counter number.  

To get it to work, you will need to supply two readings from the tape and tape counter.  You can do this by popping the tape into a cassette player with a counter and then noting the elapsed time (in minutes) and the counter number (all starting from 0 on the tape and 000 on the tape counter).  

An example from Insel's paper, we have two data points for a cassette and player he owned:

1. The counter reads 60 at 2 minutes

2. The counter reads 369 at 15 minutes

If you put these into the calculator above

(n1,T1) = (60, 2)
(n2, T2) = (369, 15)

...and wonder how much time will have elapsed when the counter reads 556, you will ll get an answer of T = 25 minutes.  This is the time one finds from the Insel's empirical table of data.
